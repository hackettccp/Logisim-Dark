<h1>Splitters</h1>

<p>When you work with multi-bit values, you will often want to route
different bits in different directions.
The Wiring library's splitter tool
(<img src="../../../icons/splitter.gif" width="16" height="16">)
allows you to accomplish this.</p>

<p>For example, suppose we want a circuit that computes the bitwise
AND of the two nibbles of its eight-bit input (the upper four bits and
the lower four bits). We will have an eight-bit value coming from the
input pin, and we want to split that into two four-bit values. In the
below circuit, we have used a splitter to accomplish this: The 8-bit input
comes into the splitter, which divides the
8 bits into two 4-bit values, which are then fed into the AND gate and from
there to the output.</p>

<p>In this example, the splitter <q>splits</q> an
incoming value into multiple outgoing values. But splitters can
also work the other way: It can <q>combine</q> multiple values into a single value. In fact,
they are non-directional: They can send values one way at one time
and another way later, and they can even do both at the same
time, as in the below example where a value travels eastward through the two
splitters, then is routed back westward through them again, and then back
eastward where it finally reaches its output.</p>

<p>The key to understanding splitters is their attributes.
In the following, the term <em>split end</em> refers to one of
the multiple wires on one side, while the term <em>combined
end</em> refers to the single wire on the other side.</p>
<ul>

<li> The <strong>Facing</strong> attribute tells where the split ends
should be relative to the combined end.</li>

<li> The <strong>Fan Out</strong> attribute specifies how many
split ends there are.</li>

<li> The <strong>Bit Width In</strong> attribute specifies the bit width of
the combined end.</li>

<li> The <strong>Bit <var>x</var></strong> attribute says which split
end corresponds to bit <em>x</em> of the combined end. If multiple
bits correspond to the same split end, then their relative ordering
will be the same as in the combined end. Logisim splitters cannot
have a bit from the combined end correspond to multiple split ends.</li>

</ul>
<p>Note that any change to the Fan Out or Bit Width In
attributes will reset all Bit <var>x</var> attributes so that
they will distribute the bits of the combined value as evenly
as possible among the split ends.</p>
