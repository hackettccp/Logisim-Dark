<h1>Pop-up menus and files</h1>

<p>The pop-up menu for memory includes four options in addition
to the options common to all components:</p>
<ul>

<li>Edit Contents: Bring up a hex editor for editing the contents
of memory.</li>

<li>Clear Contents: Resets all values in memory to 0.</li>

<li>Load Image...: Resets all values in memory based on the values
found in a file using the format described below.</li>

<li>Save Image...: Stores all values in memory into a file using
the format described below.</li>

</ul>

<p>The file format used for image files is intentionally simple;
this permits you to write a program, such as an assembler, that
generates memory images that can then be loaded into memory.
As an example of this file format, if we had a 256-byte memory whose
first five bytes were 2, 3, 0, 20, and -1, and all subsequent values
were 0, then the image would be the following text file.</p>
<blockquote><pre>
v2.0 raw
02
03
00
14
ff
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The first line identifies the file format used (currently, there is only
one file format recognized). Subsequent values list the values in
hexadecimal, starting from address 0; you can place several such
values on the same line. If there are more memory locations than are identified
in the file, Logisim will load 0 into the other memory locations.</p>

<p>The image file can use run-length encoding; for example, rather than
list the value <tt>00</tt> sixteen times in a row, the file can include
<tt>16*00</tt>. Notice
than the number of repetitions is written in base 10.
Files produced by Logisim will use run-length encoding for runs of
at least four values.</p>

<p>You can place comments into the file by using the '#' symbol: All characters
in the line starting from the '#' symbol will be ignored by Logisim.</p>
