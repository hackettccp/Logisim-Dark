<h1>Library Class</h1>

<p>The access point for the JAR library is a class that extends the
<code>Library</code> class. The library's main job is to list the tools that are
available through the library; most often, the tools are all tools
to add the various components defined - that is, instances of the
<code>AddTool</code> class working with different component factories.</p>

     * libraries contain tools, which is a slightly more general concept
     * than components; practically speaking, though, you'll most often want
     * to create AddTools for new components that can be added into the circuit.

     * Logisim accesses first when it opens the JAR file: It looks for
