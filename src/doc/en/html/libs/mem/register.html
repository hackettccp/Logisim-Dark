<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>A register stores a single multi-bit value, which is displayed in
hexadecimal within its rectangle, and is emitted on its
<var>Q</var> output. When the clock input
(indicated by a triangle on the south edge) indicates so,
the value stored in the register changes to the value of the
<var>D</var> input at that instant. Exactly when the clock input indicates
for this to happen is configured via the Trigger attribute.</p>

<p>The <var>reset</var> input resets the register's value to 0 (all
zeroes) asynchronously; that is, as long as <var>reset</var>
is 1, the value is pinned to 0, regardless of the clock input.</p>

<h2>Pins</h2>

<dl>

<dt>East edge, labeled <var>Q</var> (output, bit width matches Data Bits attribute)</dt>
<dd>Outputs the value currently stored by the register.</dd>

<dt>West edge, labeled <var>D</var> (input, bit width matches Data Bits attribute)</dt>
<dd>Data input: At the instant that the clock value rises from 0 to 1,
the register's value changes to the value of the <var>D</var> input at
that instant.</dd>

<dt>West edge, labeled <var>en</var> (input, bit width 1)</dt>
<dd>Enable: When this is 0, clock triggers are ignored. The current value
continues to appear on the output. The clock triggers are enabled when this
input is 1 or undefined.</dd>

<dt>South edge, indicated with a triangle (input, bit width 1)</dt>
<dd>Clock input: At the instant that this input value rises from 0 to
1 (the rising edge), the register's value will be updated to the value
of the <var>D</var> input.</dd>

<dt>South edge, labeled <var>0</var> (input, bit width 1)</dt>
<dd>Asynchronous reset: When 0 or undefined, this input has no effect.
As long as it is 1, the register's value is pinned to 0. This occurs
asynchronously - that is, without regard to the current clock input
value. As long as this is 1, the other inputs have no effect.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>When the component is selected or being added,
Alt-0 through Alt-9 alter its <q>Data Bits</q> attribute.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Data Bits</dt>
<dd>The bit width of the value stored in the register.</dd>

<dt>Trigger</dt>
<dd>Configures how the clock input is interpreted. The value <q>rising edge</q>
indicates that the register should update its value at the instant when the
clock rises from 0 to 1. The <q>falling edge</q> value indicates that it should
update at the instant the clock falls from 1 to 0. The <q>high level</q> value
indicates that the register should update continuously whenever the clock
input is 1. And the <q>low level</q> value indicates that it should update
continuously when the clock input is 0.</dd>

<dt>Label</dt>
<dd>The text within the label associated with the register.</dd>

<dt>Label Font</dt>
<dd>The font with which to render the label.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Poke Tool Behavior</h2>

<p>Clicking the register brings keyboard focus to the register
(indicated by a red rectangle), and typing hexadecimal digits will
change the value stored in the register.</p>

<h2>Text Tool Behavior</h2>

<p>Allows the label associated with the component to be edited.</p>
